        <h3>About</h3>
            <p>I'm a graduate student who switched from Journalism to Integrated Media because I became proficient in journalism writing, but I'm a noob when it comes to coding.</p>     
        <h3>Classes This Semester</h3>
            <p>I'm taking a course with Ciera Kirckpatrick on advertising and marketing.</p>
        <h3>Outside of Class</h3>
            <p>I work as an intern at Nelnet and watch a lot of movies and tv and I do a lot of studying on stuff that interests me.</p>
        <h3>After Graduation</h3>
            <p>I think I want to continue working at Nelnet, but I'm not entirely sure.</p>
