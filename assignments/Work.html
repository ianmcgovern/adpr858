            <h3>Literature Review</h3>
            <p>This is the project I'm doing for my friend. She wants to start a small business and needs to learn more about logistics. I'm good at doing research, so I began this endeavor to strengthen her business plan. She wants to sell shoes, I think.</p>

            <h3>Greek Studies</h3>
            <p>This won't lead anywhere, but I like learning languages, so I study this every night. I didn't pick Greek at random, I had to learn a little as part of my degree, so I decided to keep doing it.</p>
